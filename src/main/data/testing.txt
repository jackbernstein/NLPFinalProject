@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
=@AmericanAir Thanks for getting back to me. but I will find other airlines in the future.
@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible.
=@AmericanAir Sorry So Late flight, responded to your DM.
@AmericanAir Believe me, I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today.
@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers

@AmericanAir I need a flight out tonight. Isn't there anything else?

@AmericanAir - Please find my bag!! In Singapore for three days already without my bag. Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help.
@AmericanAir ‚ÄúInconvenient‚Äù is such a convenient word.
"=@AmericanAir

=@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to new york, this is disgraceful
@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this.

@AmericanAir Would love to DM you, but my Twitter app says you're not following me and I can't.
@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered "perks" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, "NO." #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@americanair Yes to the iOS. I'm running iOS 8.1.3
@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh.
@AmericanAir - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! http://t.co/0HXLNvZknP
@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again.
@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
"@AmericanAir
It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA."
=@AmericanAir I AM looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned.
@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie üòÑ
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!

@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@AmericanAir great, thanks!
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
=@AmericanAir Extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice
=@AmericanAir but, What I can ALWAYS rely on when I fly USAir Or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
=@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but united does, why is that?
=@AmericanAir right. but more than two hours Late flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
=@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
=@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. award is saver level.
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir Aww Thanks AA..DFW was on GMA up here this AM..so i understand ..Btw A.A is my Airline when im able to trv..Love you guys.:)

@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
=@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. no customer service
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, "NO."
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait
@AmericanAir Thanks so much!

=@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. if only it was avail on my next flight.
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care

=@AmericanAir my flight to dfw from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. can you help me?
=@AmericanAir the issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made So Late flight when the Gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
=@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
=@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really Sad feeling to be ignored.
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@AmericanAir I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
=@AmericanAir no response to DM Or email yet.  customer service?
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@AmericanAir Thank you.....you do the same!!
=@AmericanAir you Need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face
@AmericanAir - how long does it take to get credit to my AA account? Traveled in Jan &amp; only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response.
@AmericanAir Hopefully you ll see bad ones as opportunity to get better and not dwell in it... and the good ones as encouragement words!
@AmericanAir Okay, I think 1565 has waited long enough for a gate at DFW...
@DeltaAssist now at 57 minutes waiting on Silver Elite line for someone to pick up! Help!
@DeltaAssist what I have to say is more than 140 characters! Plus you don't follow me

@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
=@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. no customer service
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, "NO."
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait

=@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. if only it was avail on my next flight.
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
=@AmericanAir my flight to dfw from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. can you help me?
=@AmericanAir the issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made So Late flight when the Gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
=@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
=@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... not logical
@AmericanAir Nice to read it! Thank you very much!
@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!
=@AmericanAir Fuck you.
"@AmericanAir
Not giving you a hard time...Just looking for basic customer service after AA lost my bag. ETA on it's return, please????????"

@AmericanAir @dfwairport me too!!  LOVE LIVING SO CLOSE SO I ALWAYS HAVE GREAT VIEWS!
@AmericanAir Thanks!
=@AmericanAir can someone contact me about my awful experience with American airlines this weekend
=@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase
@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest.
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
@AmericanAir @dfwairport Guys, let it go. http://t.co/vOxcghciJi

@AmericanAir Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don't have a seat assignment? Seriously?
@AmericanAir @USAirways if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!!

@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside.

=@AmericanAir but not sufficiently Sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. your systems are presumably beyond reproach Or reform.

@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)
@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
@AmericanAir really? That's it? Not even a "we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time"

@AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll
@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?

@AmericanAir travel week, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, "if you want to learn more about the merger press 1", delay my connector in Chicago #deice
=@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to PREVENT Or limit interaction.
@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.
@AmericanAir That‚Äôs a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn‚Äôt understand e-mail 101.
@AmericanAir thanks! Flight 2160 today. Great crew!
@AmericanAir "Thank you for contacting American. The email address you have written to is an unmonitored account‚Äù

@AmericanAir yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I'm still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX

=@AmericanAir machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, CUST. support, and bag check in.
@AmericanAir would have been had I seen this before 1130pm EST, when I was sound asleep.
@AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues
@AmericanAir You don't have those abilities anywhere! Not at the ticket counter, at cust service, or online. That's why we're done here.
=@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city Without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?
@AmericanAir needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. People need to catch their flights! http://t.co/4MQFMxeBXt

=@AmericanAir the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing.  just wow

@AmericanAir Of course you are because that's your companies job! You guys failed at it in the first place. Upgrade me and then we'll talk.
@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead.

@AmericanAir just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen??
@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care.

@AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids.
@AmericanAir of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. Never ever ever again. #neveragain #aafail
@AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW
=@AmericanAir we have posted your response on Facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?
@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
@AmericanAir Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn't been released to inv. Help?
@AmericanAir  TPA - ORD!!! AA1679 Another successful journey, thanks for the hospitality!
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response. Much appreciated!
@AmericanAir 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight
@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!
@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
@AmericanAir any idea why flight 5392 from HSV to DFW tomorrow Cancelled Flightled about 45 minutes ago?
@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m
@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
@AmericanAir Did the policy change? I've seen people with hamsters and rabbits before.
=@AmericanAir Thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  ran with kids and flight departed. poor service at Miami
@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
=@AmericanAir right So I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
@AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry
@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
@AmericanAir my 2498 to CLT left the gate. What is next for CLT. Need help
=@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? interesting
@AmericanAir still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH
@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
=@AmericanAir is that the flight for tomorrow?
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @TheCandaceSmith Thanks for the shout-out, Candace! Enjoy the ride.‚Äù Always! I adore American Airlines!
Without notifying though? ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @krescate We don't like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us."
Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold @AmericanAir @momsgoodeats We'd #love to have you on board with us! @MandarinJourney here I come
@AmericanAir Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
=@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
=@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
=@AmericanAir Im still on hold...
@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
@AmericanAir Do we get a class discount on your wifi? I will be flying your airlines at approx. 4 Am?
@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
@AmericanAir @contactcej thanks!

=@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @delta would never treat its customers with anything less that #REF! service
=@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
@AmericanAir why do you continually play the "according to federal regulations" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service...
=@AmericanAir can I send you my trusted traveler ID to add to my reservation for TSA pre?
=@AmericanAir Thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. does that mean I have to go to the airport?????
=@AmericanAir the Folks at the executive Platinum desk are great pros.  they understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
=@AmericanAir he Thanks you. anything you can do to help. would Any further information help in the process?
@AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService
@AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?
.@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.
@AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem
@AmericanAir anything in particular I should ask for.   Will they want me to document my mileage plus status!
=@AmericanAir how about you give US a number to call Instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed.
@AmericanAir congrats on your call center customer service! A guy named Fidencio answered and he went above &amp; beyond to help me! üëåüëåüëå
@AmericanAir daughter record loc. is KYBILC. She is traveling with 3 y.o. and needs to be in adjacent seats, not across isle.
@AmericanAir Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant.  #customerexperience
@AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.
@AmericanAir I didn't want to Cancelled Flight, I wanted to take someone off and keep my price. Held at 402, at 10am today 440, now 530
@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
=@AmericanAir would you like Any additional details of my issue? airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?
@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.
@AmericanAir @maryella_green despite the inconvenience, the situation was handled quickly and we appreciate it very much!
@AmericanAir Absolutely!
@AmericanAir - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted
@AmericanAir @USAirways - I'm pregnant with twins and you're going to abandon me overnight in an airport? No hotel? When it's your fault?
@AmericanAir has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
@AmericanAir @maryella_green just received it, actually. Thank you!!!!!!!!!

=@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. we were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing.
@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane

@AmericanAir Hi, did the discount award policy for credit card holders change? No longer seeing the chart of specials on the site. Thanks!
@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?
=@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant

@AmericanAir Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now.

@AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
=@AmericanAir Thank you for the assistance

@AmericanAir Chicago seen from seat 6A, AA 1620. So far a great ride! On to PDX! http://t.co/X4rsvAGIjN
=@AmericanAir Thanks. delivery status??
@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?
@AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call?
@AmericanAir here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cFHtK60r
@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
@AmericanAir attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn't the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! http://t.co/5SdlyN9MSS
=@AmericanAir I had booked online but unable to Cancelled flight online. but FINALLY got thru.
@AmericanAir Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
@AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
@AmericanAir our flight attendant announced that we have transportation waiting for us for that flight so I think we'll make it.
@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher
@AmericanAir so whats the hold up on flight 4302?
=@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. bar none, the Best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion.
@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
@AmericanAir After being patient about my "delayed" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!
=@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. terrible customer service.
@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night
=@AmericanAir was told you could only refund me the cost of my Original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline.
@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work.
@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said "we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch"!
=@AmericanAir considering it was past midnight, I hung up and called again to receive another service call.
=@AmericanAir can I redeem AAdavantage miles on LAN flights?
@AmericanAir, I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!
@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour.
=@AmericanAir you lost a customer today. flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice
=@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the Folks handling the Calls could care less...and it shows.
=@AmericanAir Thanks
@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
@AmericanAir is there a probability that flight 1330 from DFW to DTW will be delayed or Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir THANK YOU!!! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

@AmericanAir it's GTSVYB. It says it's Cancelled Flightled when I try to check.
=@AmericanAir Thank you. they are processing my refund.
@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?
@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions.
=@AmericanAir Thanks for asking on second plane After maintenance issue, for flight from ORD to LIT. sitting at Gate in very very warm plane
@AmericanAir hey ho its not me losing any money (only you) just next make sure you stick to the "flyers right's booklet"

=@AmericanAir Thanks gang!Mind if I ask, do you handle all of your social media in house?
@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
@AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
=@AmericanAir yes I have. Thanks
@AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry

=@AmericanAir Thank you
@AmericanAir Let's all have a extraordinary week and make it a year to remember #GoingForGreat 2015 thanks so much American Airlines!!!
=@AmericanAir not helpful
@AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt
@AmericanAir but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights, then was told she couldn't.
@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
=@AmericanAir Well you spelled my name wrong.
@AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I'm not patient.  Why don't you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold
@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
=@AmericanAir no standby line update online Or on app Either is troubling
@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis
=@AmericanAir thx, just sent the DM
@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
=@AmericanAir Thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.

@AmericanAir I have the app - after my nonsense flight Cancelled Flightation yesterday I wasn't able to use the app or kiosk today. Hour long line.
=@AmericanAir Thank U!Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. lost and found goes straight to VM.

@AmericanAir are flights leaving Dallas right now? In Maui trying to figure out how delayed flight 7 is going to be
@AmericanAir, ask your new colleagues @USAirways how they handled US 728 on 21 Feb. I expect to be made whole again. Check complaint inbox.
=@AmericanAir get me outta here
@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up‚Ä¶
=@AmericanAir Really appreciate the great customer service... one of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
@AmericanAir Thank you. It's much appreciated. We have been on the plane for 90 min now at the gate.
@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it

@AmericanAir so if your genuine, give me your opinion  on what occurred last night 445 fly  from phl, to mia. No assistance at airport
@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
@AmericanAir Way to suck at customer service, Dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you didn't Cancelled Flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day.
@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
@AmericanAir Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day.
=@AmericanAir SFO. Natt (the agent who helped me) Really did an awesome job.

=@AmericanAir Thanks. having issues checking in for flight, please check our DM convo for more info.
@AmericanAir You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister
=@AmericanAir maybe you should stop Tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold Instead of hanging up on us.
@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too
=@AmericanAir when will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? all agents busy call Late Flightr..

@americanair 30 minutes since landing - flight 1531 from Miami and no luggage- what's the delay
@AmericanAir got it, so it's just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again.
@AmericanAir Define "sincerely". Your actions do not reflect what you're saying in a poor attempt to redeem yourselves on social media.
@AmericanAir I'd like to explore both options, and what the cost might be to change the date and destination.

=@AmericanAir - and @AirSouthwest  had a flight from Chicago to buffalo about an hour before our flight -- do they not care about safety?
=@AmericanAir can you?
@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?
@AmericanAir I've been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable
@AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?

=@AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would TALK to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
@AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch

@AmericanAir hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here's to another night at the airport!!
@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?
=@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
=@AmericanAir work would be much better with my Lesson Plans and music for my classes today.

@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?

@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
=@AmericanAir I Need to be back in Cleveland as early as possible tomorrow
@AmericanAir worst experience ever. @VirginAmerica all the way!
@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take "18 hours" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is "the best we can"
@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.

@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever.
@AmericanAir Flight AAL65 declared state of emergency? Squawking 7700...

@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone You apologise for HIS frustrations &amp; HIS disappointment but NOT your terrible service? #BlameShiftOverload
@AmericanAir Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
@AmericanAir How best to talk with an agent to reschedule Cancelled Flighted flight? No one answers at AA. Know it's busy, but need help.Thanks
@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.

@AmericanAir Why did  AA973 return to JFK? Thanks :)
@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that...
@AmericanAir still waiting on a dm response..... #sloooowresponses
=@AmericanAir @robinreda that can be a stop over before Paris. you are an embarrassment
=@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I AM positive you can find a plane to Europe
@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!

@AmericanAir we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.
@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays
=@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor I can speak to regarding my travels today
@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
@AmericanAir To think that I'm a "Priority Member"! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately.
@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours, call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2
@AmericanAir Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight, don't let me know, I wait on hold 30 mins, told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!
=@AmericanAir  did you guys just give up helping people? your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. connection pending
@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help
@AmericanAir Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?
=@AmericanAir overall lack of attention Or foresight when managing flights.
=@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane After landing because crew unable to figure it out
@AmericanAir Also, been on hold for 30 minutes with your "customer service" to find out when my new flight is scheduled bc your site SUCKS

@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours.
@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?
@AmericanAir I am running out of battery you have my chargers,clothes,coat,contact lenses, need to be in mtg tom need help #pathetic service
@AmericanAir Flight 4606 from MEM to DCA delayed 6 hours! Now holding breath while they keep me trapped 3 hours to de-ice. #scareair

@AmericanAir I was on a flight for tomorrow and my reservation is coming up.  Help me!
@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
=@AmericanAir understood. Thanks anyway
@AmericanAir so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?
@AmericanAir 1) I was on 1610 today to YYZ. I had a bit of a bag issue that was cleared up beautifully. Thank you to all of the check in

@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company.

=@AmericanAir anything you can do?
@AmericanAir and even worse, by the time you responded to my tweets I took two flights over five hours. And that was the quickest response!
@AmericanAir on top of that my online record was unavailable as well and then couldn't get anyone on the phone.

@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?
@AmericanAir Didn't really need anything. Saw your mentions are often negative. Keep up the good work. #gratitude  üá∫üá∏‚úàÔ∏è

=@AmericanAir wow @AmericanAir still screw n stuff up
@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.
@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!
@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, "not yet located"?
@AmericanAir i hope it takes you 6 hours to get home when it should take 20. my flight was Cancelled Flightled because they "couldn't staff the plane"
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@AmericanAir not yet. I'm next in the terminal a customer service area.
"@AmericanAir and it gets better...other passengers rebooked direct on other airlines. #whereisthelove
#whybeAAFF?"
@AmericanAir I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation, and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours.
@AmericanAir you have let me down. Seriously. #unhappycustomer
=@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and Bringing in more people? does anyone have Any business sense at AA?
@AmericanAir why do I have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
@AmericanAir she doesn't have Twitter.
=@AmericanAir at some point u Need to tell passengers What is going on. at JFK waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer
@AmericanAir seriously, I do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when I have to prepare for a family funeral.
=@AmericanAir your Gate agents at dfw Gate A16 are pathetic tonight.  terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic
@AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU
@AmericanAir yea no worries. I'm just going home to Denver. Not your fault, weather sucks bad.
@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.

=@AmericanAir the pilot told US they would release bags as Well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
=@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
@AmericanAir 37 minutes??????
=@AmericanAir  having trouble getting rebooked
@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard "your bag has not been located." üò©

@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
=@AmericanAir Instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more Gate agents.
@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
=@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
=@AmericanAir After all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
@americanair I finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
@AmericanAir ok. Pilots are looking for agents  - they jumped out / FLT 5350 #DFW / this is crazy
@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
=@AmericanAir you all should Really be ashamed. the entire business class Cabin is empty and Almost all of first class...
@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service
=@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of dfw today/tomorrow?
@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
=@AmericanAir I will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying "what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving
@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
=@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u Really Need customer svc training for your staff
@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
=@AmericanAir you guys should Really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. this has been one of the Worst experiences.
@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.

@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
@AmericanAir "We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight" is ridiculous.
@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!
@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
@AmericanAir  A true #AmericanView ...The National Mall http://t.co/N7ExdbcRHg
@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny

@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks
@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?
@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
@AmericanAir you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight

@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time
@AmericanAir what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming
@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault.
@AmericanAir Please help AA 2258 Monday Cancelled Flightled.  Can you advise on reFlight Booking Problems / refund.  Have children and need to make plans now

@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!

@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting
@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!

@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight.
@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
=@AmericanAir makes some Small improvements and retains their program they win all. they Keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ
=@AmericanAir the food served on O2402 was vile and gross.The entire Cabin did not eat their meal. survey the flight crew. another gross out
@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks.

@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick "Goodbye" Very Sad!
@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!

@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
@AmericanAir "overweight" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is.
@AmericanAir @jaynegelman How,about more@Blacklist too!!
@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
=@AmericanAir yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled.
@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA

@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses.
@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
@AmericanAir @HeyMyNameIsSEAN Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. They are gr8
@AmericanAir thanks for the show! üëç
=@AmericanAir Well Done, you have taken the fun out of Air travel @PHLAirport
@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
@AmericanAir @kconti44 This looks like JFK - had a great pic of the OneWorld jets lined up on the opposite side #Air Berlin, LAN and AA.
@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!
@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits
@AmericanAir @superyan I did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when I was at JFK a few hours ago. good luck w/flights!
@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport
@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
@AmericanAir Yo, could that be a catering truck before mine eyes?  Unmoving? http://t.co/ASW6QwUf1Z
@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one planeüò°
@AmericanAir Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvSLtQZKmQ
@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
@AmericanAir 901 #Miami to #Rio to participate at @RCM_Oficial representing @CisnerosMedia #yourstoryhere

@AmericanAir who's your pick for best picture? I don't want to board your airline until I know
@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
=@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. nothing else even Registers for you dinosaurs

@AmericanAir @manuel_c "here for you" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or....
@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got
@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS
@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?
=@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
=@AmericanAir its pulling away from Gate to get your departure time then leaving US on Tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.
@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!
@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots
=@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap

@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
=@AmericanAir FINALLY about to take off!Thanks for the customer service by the #REF! reps @#REF! @ CTL. Any idea What caused the system failure?
=@AmericanAir trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. can you help me rebook?
=@AmericanAir I have Tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. can no one at American airlines help me?
=@AmericanAir close down
@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
=@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
=@AmericanAir Really? not even worthy of a response. this is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
=@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the Gate team on the next leg?
@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
=@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
=@AmericanAir why does your iPhone app not have Any sort of notifications option?
@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
=@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that Or second flight. losing my biz.
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting

=@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then I will never fly with you guys again.
"@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue
in Customer Service?

=@AmericanAir you should be contacting her for a refund - DM me and I will provide phone number
@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
=@AmericanAir this is ridiculous!You all Really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins
@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
=@AmericanAir pathetic to have your Gate agents Lie to my face when you are at fault
@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.

@AmericanAir lost my wife's luggage and nobody gives you and answer, all they say is go here or call there.
=@AmericanAir check your DM pls
@AmericanAir why don't you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
=@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty Or hoops.

=@AmericanAir a phone call Or email when you Cancelled flight a flight would be lovely.
=@AmericanAir a guy try right...

@AmericanAir Haha I had a boarding pass for 12B, was boarding the plane and the gate agent told me to go to 41G. I'm here now. No worries.
=@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from dfw to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
As am I, @AmericanAir - but thankfully there was a @united lounge next door. Really not impressed by oneworld partnerships :(
=@AmericanAir delayed.....wow
@AmericanAir My flt AA375 for 02/23 got cncled and i cant get hold of a CSR so i can get alternate arrangement. Plz help
@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports AA1224: 45 mins for Priority bags to arrive, now Late Flight for evening plans! Delta 20 min bag guarantee anyone? :(
@AmericanAir sitting in a 2 hour long at least phone queue. Hoping I get things rebooked in time or at least some plastic wings. #tears
@AmericanAir it's always better to find out equipment is INOP on the ground than in the air! #safetyfirst

@AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up.
=@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly.
@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me
@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
@AmericanAir 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one
@AmericanAir 1138 got us to LGA safely. Thanks for taking the time to make the plane safe before flying!
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn't notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can't get through to an agent. Epic. Fail.
@AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she's prob stressed, but I am too! An "aw, let me help" cld mk it btr
@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way.
@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ‚úà :-)
@AmericanAir I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff
@AmericanAir complt incompetence on flt 295.Lav delay from a pln that lnded last nite, no internet and poor svc. Not what I expect from u.
@AmericanAir Just landed - crew couldn't have been more gracious or accommodating. Although a long delay I appreciate your prompt response!
=@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing

@AmericanAir my return flight is scheduled on Wednesday; AA138 I believe.  Thanks for the help!

.@AmericanAir nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same.

@AmericanAir if business class if full but 1st class empty, do you guys upgrade EXP members to 1st?

@AmericanAir @Stone9956 Do you dislike delays when they're caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end?
=@AmericanAir can you guys help me please?
@AmericanAir @travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.
